# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

> Very confident as long as the code is easy.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

> I have a little experience with other coding languages and have developed tools to search for questions online effectively. I did not struggle with this exercise.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

> There was nothing I go stuck on in this case.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
> Google has been very effective so far. The questions I've been asking are simple enough that finding the answers is easy.
